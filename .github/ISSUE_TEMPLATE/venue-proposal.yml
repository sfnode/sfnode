            Thanks so much for your interest in hosting SFNode!
            
            The event host typically provides food and drink, but if you're not able to we can usually find a sponsor for that. Each month we feature 2-3 talks about Node.js, server-side JavaScript, npm and the surrounding ecosystem. We try to find a good balance between beginner and advanced topics.
